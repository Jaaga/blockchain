						<h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
							<p>
								Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system 
								and a completely digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment 
								network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. 
								From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet. 
								Bitcoin can also be seen as the most prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in existence. 

							</p>

							<h2>Why Bitcoin?</h2>

							<h3>Payment freedom</h3>
							<p>
								It is possible to send and receive any amount of 
								money instantly anywhere in the world at any time. 
								No bank holidays. 
								No borders. 
								No imposed limits. 
								Bitcoin allows its users to be in full control of their money.
							</p>

							<h3>Very low fees</h3>
							<p>
								 Bitcoin payments are currently processed with either no fees or extremely small fees.
								 Users may include fees with transactions to receive priority processing, 
								 which results in faster confirmation of transactions by the network. 
								 Additionally, merchant processors exist to assist merchants in processing transactions,
								 converting bitcoins to fiat currency and depositing funds directly into merchants' bank accounts daily. 
								 As these services are based on Bitcoin, they can be offered for much lower fee than with PayPal or credit card networks.
							</p>	 

							<h3>Fewer risks for merchants</h3>
							<p> 
								 Bitcoin transactions are secure, irreversible, and do not contain customersâ€™ sensitive or personal information. 
								 This protects merchants from losses caused by fraud or fraudulent chargebacks, and there is no need for PCI compliance. 
								 Merchants can easily expand to new markets where either credit cards are not available, or fraud rates are 
								 unacceptably high. 
								 The net results are lower fees, larger markets, and fewer administrative costs.
							</p>	 

							<h3>Security and control</h3>
							<p>
								 Bitcoin users are in full control of their transactions; 
								 it is impossible for merchants to force unwanted or unnoticed charges as can happen with other payment methods. 
								 Bitcoin payments can be made without personal information tied to the transaction. 
								 This offers strong protection against identity theft. 
								 Bitcoin users can also protect their money with backup and encryption.
							</p>

							<h3>Transparent and neutral</h3>
							<p>
								All information concerning the Bitcoin money supply  itself is readily available on the block chain for anybody to verify and use in real-time. 
								No individual or organization can control or manipulate the Bitcoin protocol because it is cryptographically secure. 
								This allows the core of Bitcoin to be trusted for being completely neutral, transparent and predictable.
